    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of Wet Water&#8482 is to aid our potential customers into purchasing a tour
      of the greatest river rapids there are! These river rapids are located in farmer joe's
      backyard. We hope to accomplish a high page rank with this website, so it appears as the
      top google search result. We aim to make this site the main source of our profit, so we
      can finally pay back farmer joe for our continual trespassing on his property and stream.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      We target those poor individuals who are away on their honeymoon and don't know how to
      spot a scam. We feel these individuals have the best chance of paying us money. They make
      up a large part of the US population, so we will always have enough people looking at our
      website as to make a profit. We expect them to use a phone to view this page, thus the page
      will be arranged to be easily viewable on phone. The theme of the website will be firstly
      clickbait, secondly a slightly off-putting color scheme intended to lure away those who
      would sue us, and lastly a maze of links that all lead to a paywall.
